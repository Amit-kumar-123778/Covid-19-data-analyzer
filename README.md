The COVID-19 Data Analyzer is a Python-based project designed to explore and visualize COVID-19 datasets to uncover meaningful insights and trends. It performs data cleaning, handles missing values, detects outliers, and conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the spread and impact of the virus. The project includes visualizations such as time-series plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to illustrate daily cases, deaths, recoveries, and comparisons across countries or regions. Built using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly within a Jupyter Notebook environment, it provides a clear and interactive view of pandemic data. The analysis draws from reputable sources such as Johns Hopkins University and the World Health Organization.
